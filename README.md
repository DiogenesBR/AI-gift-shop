# Simple AI gift shop
Done as a freelance project for a client. The client wanted a simple AI gift shop that would recommend gifts based on the user's input.

It's more like a proof of concept than a finished product.

It uses:

- Flask, Jinja2 and Bootstrap 5 for the UI.
- It uses OpenAI's API and SerpApi to get the data.
- Guidance for making the prompts.

### How to run
1. Clone the repository

2. Install the requirements

3. rename `config.example.py` to `config.py`

4. Add your API keys to `config.py`

2. Run `python run.py` in the terminal
